# Skill: Design System Standards

## Purpose
Ensure all UI work aligns with a coherent design system and visual language.

## Reference
See: `standards/frontend/design-system.md`

## When to apply
- Designing new UI elements or screens
- Creating or updating shared components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- Reviewing frontend changes for consistency and polish

## Instructions
1. Read `standards/frontend/design-system.md`.
2. Apply:
   - design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, radius, shadows)
   - consistent use of primitives (`Button`, `Input`, `Card`, etc.)
   - standard interaction states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled)
3. Avoid:
   - hard-coded ad-hoc styles scattered across the app
   - one-off components that bypass shared primitives
4. Ensure:
   - layouts follow consistent spacing and grid rules
   - brand styling is centralized, not duplicated
   - new components are documented and ready for reuse

Treat the design system as the single source of truth for UI decisions.
