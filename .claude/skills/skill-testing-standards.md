# Skill: Testing Standards

## Purpose
Ensure all new code and feature implementations follow world-class testing philosophy.

## Reference
See: `standards/global/testing-principles.md`

## When to apply
- designing tests
- implementing features
- code reviews
- bug-fixing

## Instructions
1. Read `standards/global/testing-principles.md` before writing or evaluating tests.
2. Apply:
   - test pyramid (unit → integration → E2E)
   - Arrange → Act → Assert pattern
   - deterministic, readable tests
   - meaningful naming
3. Check for coverage of:
   - happy path
   - edge cases
   - regressions
   - state transitions

Build confidence, not busywork.
