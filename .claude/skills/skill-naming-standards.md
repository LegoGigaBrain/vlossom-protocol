# Skill: Naming Standards

## Purpose
Apply consistent, world-class naming conventions across all code, APIs, schemas, and documentation.

## Reference
See: `standards/global/naming.md`

## When to use this skill
- implementing new code
- reviewing code
- designing APIs, DB schemas, contract functions
- writing documentation or specs

## Instructions
Before writing or reviewing code:
1. Open and read `standards/global/naming.md`.
2. Apply its rules to:
   - variables
   - functions
   - components
   - files
   - endpoints
   - database columns
   - contract names
3. If naming conflicts arise:
   - choose the clearest, most literal name
   - avoid abbreviations and metaphors
4. Ensure all naming follows:
   - consistent casing rules
   - consistent domain terminology

Good naming = clarity + maintainability.
