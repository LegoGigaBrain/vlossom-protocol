# Skill: UX Review Checklist

## Purpose
Ensure UX flows are coherent, clear, and aligned with product goals.

## Checklist

- [ ] The primary user goal of the flow is clearly defined.
- [ ] Each step in the flow has a clear “why” and “what next”.
- [ ] Terminology is consistent across the interface.
- [ ] Empty states explain what to do next and why the user is seeing them.
- [ ] Error states provide helpful guidance, not just “something went wrong”.
- [ ] Destructive or irreversible actions are confirmed or undoable.
- [ ] Keyboard and touch interactions are considered where relevant.
- [ ] Mobile layouts are accounted for (no critical actions hidden off-screen).
- [ ] Privacy and data sensitivity are respected in UI (no oversharing in toasts/logs).
