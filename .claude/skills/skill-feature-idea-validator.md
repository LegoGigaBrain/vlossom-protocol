# Skill: Feature Idea Validator

## Purpose
Evaluate feature ideas against product mission, core loops, and current stage.

## Checks

- Alignment with:
  - project mission
  - target users
- Fit with core product loop(s)
  - e.g. discover → choose → act → pay → review
- Stage-appropriate:
  - MVP vs post-MVP vs scale features
- Impact vs Effort:
  - user impact
  - technical complexity
- Dependencies and risk:
  - infra requirements
  - external integrations
  - protocol changes

## When to apply

- Before writing new feature specs
- During roadmap discussions and prioritisation

## Instructions

1. Summarize the idea in your own words.
2. Score:
   - mission alignment (Low / Medium / High)
   - user impact (Low / Medium / High)
   - complexity (Low / Medium / High)
3. Suggest:
   - Build now
   - Build later
   - Reframe (change the feature)
   - Drop (not worth it now)
4. If “build now”:
   - Outline a minimal first version for specs.
