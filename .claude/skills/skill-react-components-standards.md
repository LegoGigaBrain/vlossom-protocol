# Skill: React Components Standards

## Purpose
Ensure all React components are clean, composable, accessible, and easy to maintain.

## Reference
See: `standards/frontend/react-components.md`

## When to apply
- When creating new React components
- When refactoring or reviewing frontend code
- When designing new UI flows or shared UI primitives

## Instructions
1. Read `standards/frontend/react-components.md` before writing or reviewing React code.
2. Apply the principles to:
   - component structure (container vs presentational)
   - props and state design
   - hooks usage
   - handling loading/error/empty states
   - accessibility and semantics
3. Ensure:
   - components are small and focused
   - data fetching and UI rendering are clearly separated where appropriate
   - JSX is readable and not deeply nested
   - keyboard and screen-reader accessibility is considered

All React work must reflect these standards by default.
