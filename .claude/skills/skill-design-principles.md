# Skill: S-Tier Design Principles

## Purpose
Apply world-class product and dashboard design principles (inspired by tools like Stripe, Linear, Airbnb) to all UI, UX flows, and design reviews.

## Reference
See: `standards/frontend/design-principles.md`

## When to apply
- Designing new screens or flows
- Reviewing or refactoring existing UI
- Running `/design-review`
- Helping engineers implement designs in React

## Instructions

1. Before doing any design-related work:
   - Read `standards/frontend/design-principles.md`.
2. Use the checklist to evaluate:
   - clarity and focus of each screen
   - hierarchy, layout, and spacing
   - use of design tokens and core components
   - loading/empty/error/success states
   - accessibility and responsive behavior
   - copy and UX writing quality
3. In design reviews:
   - call out where the implementation:
     - follows these principles well (strengths)
     - breaks or weakly applies them (concerns)
   - give specific, practical suggestions tied back to the principles.
4. When principles conflict with constraints (time, legacy systems, etc.):
   - make the trade-offs explicit
   - recommend a “minimum viable improvement” path

All design or UI/UX review work in LEGO OS MUST respect these principles by default.
