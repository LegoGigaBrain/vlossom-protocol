# Skill: Code Style Standards

## Purpose
Ensure code is elegant, consistent, predictable, and easy for senior engineers to maintain.

## Reference
See: `standards/global/code-style.md`

## When to apply
- every time you implement or modify code
- during code reviews
- while generating examples, refactors, or architecture updates

## Instructions
1. Read `standards/global/code-style.md` before coding.
2. Apply:
   - small functions
   - early returns
   - clear error handling
   - async/await correctly
   - safe defensive coding
   - explicit types
3. Avoid:
   - deep nesting
   - implicit conversions
   - silent errors
   - unclear logic and side-effects

Always optimize for clarity and correctness first.
