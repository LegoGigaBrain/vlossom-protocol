## 🌺 VLOSSOM APP — THE RAW FOUNDATIONAL BRIEF

A platform to digitize, formalize and uplift the natural hair care salon economy across Africa and beyond.

---

## 1. Introduction


Vlossom is an app designed for the natural hair care salon business in Africa, with a core purpose:

To digitally connect customers, stylists, and property owners into a seamless on-demand ecosystem — formalizing an informal industry and empowering every participant.

The concept began with a simple idea:

“Uber for natural hair services.”

But evolved into much more:

Hair service bookings

Mobile stylists

Property owners renting chairs

Professional profiles

Ratings

Scheduling tools

Payments

Admin support

Reputation

Education and accreditation

Real-world scalability

## The long-term goal:
Create a platform that empowers stylists, uplifts customers, and creates a new passive income economy for property owners.

---

## 2. Core Users


From day one, Vlossom focuses on three main user groups:

1. Customers (Clients)

People seeking reliable, skilled natural hair services.

2. Natural Hair Stylists

Freelancers, mobile stylists, shop-based stylists, specialists, niche experts.

3. Property Owners

People who have chairs, rooms, or space to rent out as service points — enabling stylists to work professionally without owning a full salon.

This creates a three-sided marketplace, each supporting and benefiting the other.

---

## 3. Immediate Context (Day 1 Reality)


In the beginning:

Most stylists will NOT have property owners registered yet.

Most bookings will be between customers and stylists directly.

Stylists will often operate from:

home salons

shared salons

informal rented chairs

mobile appointments

Vlossom must support all of this seamlessly.

Property owners will come later, but the platform should already be architected to include them.

---

## 4. Purpose & Goals


## 4.1 Primary Goal

To formalize the natural hair care economy through technology:

Professional profiles

Ratings and reviews

Verified / accredited stylists

Transparent service prices

Reliable scheduling

Better customer trust

Exposure for stylists

Admin tools for business growth

Location flexibility


## 4.2 Broader Goal

To empower micro-entrepreneurs across Africa:

Stylists → become business owners

Property owners → create passive income

Customers → enjoy reliable, professional service

Communities → uplifted by quality stylists & safe environments

---

## 5. How Stylists Operate


## Stylists should be able to:

Create a full stylist profile

Set their services, prices, durations

Add a location or toggle “mobile”

Accept / decline bookings

Manage their calendar

Build ratings and reviews

Gain exposure to new customers


## Some stylists:

travel to clients (mobile)

work from a fixed place

work from multiple spaces

rent chairs only when needed

The app must support ALL these patterns.

---

## 6. How Customers Use the App


## Customers should be able to:

Choose a date, location, service type

See available stylists nearby

View stylist profiles (reviews, ratings, pictures)

Submit booking requests

Pay securely

Track their upcoming appointments

Rate stylists afterwards


## Customers should find:

the nearest stylist

the most skilled stylist

the stylist with the best reviews

the stylist with the best availability

or their favorite stylist

The app should support all workflows.

7. Property Owners (The Blue Ocean)

A groundbreaking part of Vlossom:

Allow property owners to register spaces and rent salon chairs

This solves:

safety concerns for house calls

inconsistency in mobile service environments

lack of professional equipment

stylist access to high-quality spaces

new income streams for property owners

Property owners can:

list available chairs

set rental rates (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)

specify amenities

indicate availability

receive reviews

earn passive income

The customer doesn’t need to know how stylist and property owner coordinate — the experience should feel seamless.
