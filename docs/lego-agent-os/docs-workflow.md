# LEGO OS – Documentation Workflow

This describes how to use LEGO OS to create and maintain documentation.

## Modes

- General docs → `/write-docs`
- GitBook docs → `/gitbook-docs`
- Doc reviews → use `/write-docs` in review mode with existing files

## Recommended Flow

1. Define audience and purpose.
2. Use `/write-docs` to outline and draft.
3. If targeting GitBook, use `/gitbook-docs`:
   - design navigation
   - generate GitBook-ready pages.
4. Keep docs in PRs alongside code changes.

Docs are part of the product, not an afterthought.
