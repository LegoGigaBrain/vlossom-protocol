LEGO Agent OS — Manual

A reusable, modular multi-agent operating system for Claude Code.
Designed for world-class software development, Solidity protocol work, backend systems, UX flows, documentation, and automated spec-driven execution.

LEGO OS gives you:

a multi-layer context system

agents that act as senior specialists

skills that enforce standards

commands that orchestrate multi-agent workflows

templates that bootstrap mission, roadmap, tech-stack, and feature specifications

and a context-sync engine that keeps everything up to date.

1. What LEGO OS is

A fully structured, high-discipline development environment that turns Claude Code into:

a senior engineering team

a protocol design lab

a product & UX department

a specification engine

a documentation factory

a continuous reviewer

It runs on 3 layers:

2. The 3-Layer Context Model (Standards → Product → Specs)
Layer 1 — Standards: HOW we build

Located under:
standards/global/*
standards/backend/*
standards/frontend/*
standards/security/*
.claude/skills/*

Standards define:

naming

code style

data modelling

API design

UX & design principles

security principles

smart contract audit standards

test authoring patterns

doc-writing principles

Agents must obey standards unless explicitly overridden.

Layer 2 — Product: WHAT we are building

Autogenerated from:
product-templates/mission.template.md
product-templates/roadmap.template.md
product-templates/tech-stack.template.md
product-templates/changelog.template.md

Created and updated via:

/product-plan

/context-sync

Resulting in:
docs/project/mission.md
docs/project/roadmap.md
docs/project/tech-stack.md
docs/project/changelog.md

These define:

the purpose

the long-term direction

the system architecture decisions

how the product will evolve over time


Layer 3 — Specs: WHAT we are building next

Autogenerated from:
spec-templates/feature-spec.template.md
spec-templates/tasks-breakdown.template.md
spec-templates/verification-checklist.template.md

Created via:

/spec-and-plan

(and kept up-to-date via /context-sync)

Resulting in feature folders:
docs/specs/<feature>/
  feature-spec.md
  tasks-breakdown.md
  verification-checklist.md

This layer powers:

implementation

code review

security audits

verification

documentation

Everything is feature-driven and template-aligned.

3. How to Create a New Agent

Duplicate templates/TEMPLATE_AGENT.md

Name the file: .claude/agents/<agent-name>.md

Fill:

mission

responsibilities

workflow

standards awareness

Save — Claude Code loads it automatically.

Agents should represent senior specialists, not junior roles.

4. How to Create a New Command

Duplicate templates/TEMPLATE_COMMAND.md

Place it in .claude/commands/

Define:

Goal

Primary + supporting agents

Step-by-step workflow

Run via /your-command

Commands orchestrate multi-agent operations like:

/product-plan

/spec-and-plan

/context-sync

/smart-contract-review

/verify-implementation

5. How to Create a New Skill

Duplicate templates/TEMPLATE_SKILL.md

Place in .claude/skills/

Fill in:

purpose

checklists

patterns to follow

Reference skills in appropriate agent specs.

Skills enforce standards across every agent.

6. Best Practices

Keep CLAUDE.md files small, precise, layered.

Use Explore → Plan → Execute for every workflow.

For high-risk tasks:

involve senior-architect

involve security-auditor

involve solidity-protocol-engineer

Prefer small, composable code changes.

Update tests with every behavioural change.

Update docs with /write-docs after major work.

7. MCP Integration

LEGO OS is MCP-ready.

Recommended MCPs:

Playwright MCP (end-to-end UI testing)

Filesystem / Git MCP (repo changes, commits)

HTTP/Webhook MCP (API mocks, payment/onramp flows)

ESLint/Prettier MCPs (lint/fix frontend code)

Solidity compiler/formatter MCP (if available)

Document enabled MCPs inside:

CLAUDE.project.md or project-specific CLAUDE.md

relevant agent specs (UX, backend, solidity)

8. Built-in Commands (Workflows)

LEGO OS comes with powerful end-to-end commands:

/product-plan

Generate and update:

mission

roadmap

tech stack

changelog

Fully aligned with product-templates.

/spec-and-plan

Generate or update feature spec packages:

feature-spec.md

tasks-breakdown.md

verification-checklist.md

/context-sync

Audit and repair project documentation:

ensures CLAUDE files exist in all key folders

ensures project docs exist

ensures specs match code

suggests or triggers /product-plan and /spec-and-plan

/smart-contract-review

Deep structured audit using:

Security Auditor

Solidity Protocol Engineer

DeFi Risk Engineer

Smart Contract Auditor Skill

/security-review

Platform-wide security audit.

/verify-implementation

Check code against verification checklists.

9. Root Philosophy

LEGO OS is built around:

repeatable structure

template-driven specifications

clear agent responsibilities

disciplined code execution

context clarity

senior-level judgment

This is not a chatbot.
It is a full AI engineering organization that you can drop into any repo.
