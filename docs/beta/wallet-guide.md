# Wallet & Payments Guide

## Understanding Your Smart Wallet

When you create a Vlossom account, we automatically create a **smart wallet** for you. This is your personal wallet on the blockchain that holds your USDC balance.

### What Makes It "Smart"?

1. **No Gas Fees**: We sponsor all transaction fees for you
2. **Email Login**: No seed phrases or crypto wallets needed
3. **Automatic Creation**: Ready to use as soon as you sign up
4. **Secure**: Only you can authorize transactions

### Your Wallet Address

Your wallet has a unique address (like `0x1234...abcd`). This is your identifier on the blockchain. You can:

- View it in your wallet section
- Share it to receive funds from others
- Use it for QR code payments

## USDC - The Currency

### What is USDC?

USDC is a **stablecoin** - a digital currency that maintains a 1:1 value with the US Dollar.

- 1 USDC = $1 USD (always)
- Fast, low-cost transactions
- Widely accepted in crypto

### Why USDC?

We chose USDC because:
- **Stable Value**: No crypto price volatility
- **Low Fees**: Cheaper than credit card processing
- **Fast**: Transactions settle in seconds
- **Global**: Works anywhere in the world

## Funding Your Wallet

### During Beta: The Faucet

During our beta period, you can claim **free test USDC** from our faucet:

1. Go to your **Wallet** page
2. Click **"Claim from Faucet"**
3. Receive **1,000 test USDC** instantly
4. Wait 24 hours before claiming again

> **Note**: Test USDC has no real value and only works on our testnet.

### After Beta: MoonPay

After launch, you'll be able to add funds using:

- **Credit/Debit Card**: Visa, Mastercard
- **Bank Transfer**: Direct deposit
- **Apple Pay / Google Pay**: Quick checkout

## The Escrow System

### How It Works

When you book a service:

1. **Payment Locked**: Your USDC is transferred to a smart contract (escrow)
2. **Service Performed**: The stylist completes your appointment
3. **Funds Released**: Payment automatically goes to the stylist

### Why Escrow?

Escrow protects everyone:

**For Customers:**
- Don't pay until service is complete
- Automatic refunds on cancellation
- Dispute resolution available

**For Stylists:**
- Guaranteed payment for completed work
- No chargebacks or payment reversals
- Immediate access to funds

### Escrow States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Locked** | Funds held during booking |
| **Released** | Paid to stylist on completion |
| **Refunded** | Returned to customer on cancellation |

## Platform Fees

### Fee Structure

| Party | Fee |
|-------|-----|
| Platform Fee | 5% |
| Transaction Fee | $0 (we pay) |

### Example

For a R1,000 service:
- Customer pays: R1,000
- Stylist receives: R950 (95%)
- Platform fee: R50 (5%)

All fees are included in the quoted price - no surprises!

## Withdrawing Funds

### For Stylists

After completing services, your earnings are in your wallet. To withdraw:

1. Go to **Wallet** → **Withdraw**
2. Enter your bank details
3. Specify amount (minimum R100)
4. Confirm withdrawal
5. Funds arrive in 1-3 business days

### Withdrawal Limits

| Type | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Minimum | R100 |
| Daily | R50,000 |
| Monthly | R500,000 |

## Security

### Protecting Your Wallet

- **Two-Factor Auth**: Enable 2FA for extra security
- **Session Management**: Review active sessions
- **Transaction Alerts**: Get notified of wallet activity

### What We Don't Store

- Private keys (managed by smart contracts)
- Full card numbers (handled by MoonPay)
- Passwords in plain text (always hashed)

## Troubleshooting

### "Transaction Failed"

1. Check your balance is sufficient
2. Wait a moment and try again
3. Contact support if issue persists

### "Faucet Unavailable"

- You can only claim once per 24 hours
- Check if you've already claimed today
- Wait until the cooldown period ends

### "Withdrawal Pending"

- Bank transfers take 1-3 business days
- Check your bank details are correct
- Contact support if delayed beyond 5 days
