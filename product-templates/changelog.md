# Changelog

Use this document to track meaningful changes to the product over time.

## 1. Conventions

- Versioning scheme:
  - e.g., `v0.1.0` for pre-launch, `v1.0.0` for first stable public release.
- Change categories:
  - Added
  - Changed
  - Fixed
  - Removed
  - Security (if relevant)
- Scope:
  - Only record changes that matter to users, developers, or operators.

You can adapt these conventions to the project, but keep them consistent once chosen.
